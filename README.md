# RoUnlock
RoUnlock is a free to use tool to remove the FPS lock on your roblox instance. 

# Why? 
as i was looking for alternatives to the axstins FPS unlocker i found the link: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-unlock-the-60-fps-cap-withwithout-software/2220352 it was better than axstins but, it was tedious and annoying to manually place the files inside of the roblox directory. So, being the good lad that i am i decided to make a script to automate that for us (: 

# Why is RoUnlock Better? 
With other popular FPS unlockers like axstin/rbxfpsunlocker you have to keep it running as an active process that constantly writes to memory in game and also refuses to work after roblox updates. With RoUnlock you simply run the script **ONCE** until the next roblox update comes along and removes the JSON file. This script also requires no updating whatsoever, so if a Roblox update comes along all you need to do is run this script and viola, your FPS is unlocked. No more waiting for updates. 

# Anything else?
Requires no dependencies other than having Python installed from the windows store, thank you standard library! Thank you all, god bless.
